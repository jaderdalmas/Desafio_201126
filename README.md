# What about it
--> is a .net core application on version 3.1 following some of microservices patterns and event bus for a point solution

--> there are no database and the data are on memory and also the event bus is static

# What to test
--> Calculus as age, bus calls and convertion, critical processes as signup and statistics, other processes as cruds

# To be improved 
--> Segreggate rules and apply Clean Code and KISS on repos and services may help keep controllers ruleless

--> Have a not static bus, in order use a persistent solution and return that code for future searches

--> Create a solution map to easy code vision and help future improvements

--> Integrate to a database and move memory repository into it

# Extra (swagger | health)
--> I am used to add swagger and health to easy tests start, but after implementing integration ones it may not be needed for this purpouses
